    <h1>Owning a Pet</h1>
    <p>
      Owning a pet is very rewarding. Pet ownership however is often hard and
      very expensive for a variety of reasons. One of these reasons being that
      pets need to visit the vet. Pets can also be hard to own as they often
      will do things you do not want them to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      However even with these facts a lot of people find having a pet to be
      better than not. Pets come in all different kinds for all different types
      of people. Some people prefer cats because they are less maintenance. Some
      people prefer dogs due to their loyalty
